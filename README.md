Decentralized Lost and Found Registry

Difficulty: Medium (300 G-Coins)

Description:
Lost items are hard to reunite with owners. Develop a blockchain app where users register lost or found items, with ownership verified via a public ledger.

Minimum Requirements:

• Authentication and authorization for users.
• User interface for registering and browsing items.
• Mock blockchain ledger for item records (static data).
• Simple search or filter feature.
• Responsive design for accessibility.

Expected Outcome:

• A functional website or mobile app prototype demonstrating item registration.
• A short demo or presentation showcasing the solution, user flow, and technical implementation.
